# Secure Mail Transfer Protocol Project

## Objectives

In this collaborative project, we aim to develop a reasonably secure mail transfer protocol. Through our collective effort, we will gain practical experience in several key areas:

1. Programming clients and servers in a UNIX-like environment.
2. Utilizing the fork function to manage multiple client connections through multiple processes.
3. Implementing security measures to protect the application.
4. Identifying and mitigating potential attacks against our protocol to enhance security.
